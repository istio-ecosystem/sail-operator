One week before a release, the release branch goes into a state of code freeze. At this point only critical release
blocking bugs are addressed. Additional changes that are targeted for new features and capabilities will not be merged.

# Create a release

When all preparations are done, a release can be created via the GitHub Actions workflow `Release workflow`.
