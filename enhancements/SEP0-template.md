# SEP Template

## Overview
Some short paragraphs on what the enhancement attempts to solve and why it's important.

## Goals
Itemized list of things you want to achieve. Can be functional/nonfunctional requirements.

## Non-goals
Itemized list of things specifically excluded from the design. Could be either to simplify the review or to avoid misunderstandings.

## Design
This is free-form; use as many or few subheadings as appropriate. The following are just examples, use them only if they apply to your SEP.

### User Stories

### API Changes

### Architecture

### Performance Impact

### Backward Compatibility

### Kubernetes vs OpenShift vs Other Distributions

## Alternatives Considered
Other approaches that have been discussed and discarded during or before the creation of the SEP. Should include the reasons why they have not been chosen.

## Implementation Plan
In the beginning, this should give a rough overview of the work required to implement the SEP. Later on when the SEP has been accepted, this should list the epics that have been created to track the work.

## Test Plan
When and how can this be tested? We'll want to automate testing as much as possible, so we need to start about testability early.

## Change History (only required when making changes after SEP has been accepted)
