== Introduction to Istio Waypoint Proxy

Ambient mesh splits Istio's functionality into two distinct layers, a secure overlay layer 4 (L4) and a Layer 7 (L7). The waypoint proxy is an optional component that is Envoy-based and handles L7 processing for workloads it manages. It acts as a gateway to a resource (a namespace, service or pod). Waypoint proxies are installed, upgraded and scaled independently from applications. They can be configured using the Kubernetes https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/[Gateway API].

[[core-features]]
=== Core features

If your applications require any of the following L7 mesh functions, you will need to use a waypoint proxy in ambient mode:

- Traffic management: HTTP routing & load balancing, circuit breaking, rate limiting, fault injection, retries and timeouts
- Security: Rich authorization policies based on L7 primitives such as request type or HTTP header
- Observability: HTTP metrics, access logging and tracing

[[getting-started]]
== Getting Started

[[prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

Waypoint proxies are deployed using Kubernetes Gateway resources. As of Kubernetes 1.30 and OpenShift 4.17, the Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs are not available by default and must be installed to be used. This can be done with the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io &> /dev/null || \
  { kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.2.0/standard-install.yaml; }
----

[[set-up-istio-ambient-mode-resources-and-a-sample-application]]
=== Set up Istio Ambient Mode Resources and a Sample Application

1. Install the Sail Operator along with Istio in ambient mode using the link:istio-ambient-mode.adoc#installation-on-openshift[following] steps.

2. Deploy the sample Bookinfo applications. The steps can be found link:istio-ambient-mode.adoc#deploy-a-sample-application[here].

Before you deploy a waypoint proxy in the application namespace, confirm the namespace is labeled with `istio.io/dataplane-mode: ambient`.

[[deploy-a-waypoint-proxy]]
=== Deploy a Waypoint Proxy

1. Deploy a waypoint proxy in the bookinfo namespace:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  labels:
    istio.io/waypoint-for: service
  name: waypoint
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
EOF
----

The `istio.io/waypoint-for: service` label on the Gateway resource specifies that it processes traffic for services, which is the default behavior. The type of traffic a waypoint handles is determined by this label. For more details you can refer to Istio https://istio.io/latest/docs/ambient/usage/waypoint/#waypoint-traffic-types[documentation].

2. Enroll the bookinfo namespace to use the waypoint:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl label ns bookinfo istio.io/use-waypoint=waypoint
----

After a namespace is enrolled to use a waypoint, any requests from any pods using the ambient data plane mode, to any service running in the `bookinfo` namespace, will be routed through the waypoint for L7 processing and policy enforcement.

If you prefer more granularity than using a waypoint for an entire namespace, you can enroll only a specific service or pod to use a waypoint by labeling the respective service or the pod. When enrolling a pod explicitly, you must also add the `istio.io/waypoint-for: workload` label to the Gateway resource.

[[cross-namespace-waypoint]]
==== Cross-namespace Waypoint

By default, a waypoint is usable only within the same namespace, but it also supports cross-namespace usage. The following Gateway allows resources in the `bookinfo` namespace to use `waypoint-foo` from the `foo` namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: waypoint-foo
  namespace: foo
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Selector
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: bookinfo
----

By default, the Istio control plane will look for a waypoint specified using the `istio.io/use-waypoint` label in the same namespace as the resource which the label is applied to. You can add labels `istio.io/use-waypoint-namespace` and `istio.io/use-waypoint` together to start using the cross-namespace waypoint.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl label ns bookinfo istio.io/use-waypoint-namespace=foo
kubectl label ns bookinfo istio.io/use-waypoint=waypoint-foo
----

[[layer-7-features-in-ambient-mode]]
== Layer 7 Features in Ambient Mode

The following section describes the stable features using Gateway API resource `HTTPRoute` and Istio resource `AuthorizationPolicy`. Other L7 features using a waypoint proxy will be discussed when they reach to Beta status.

[[traffic-routing]]
=== Traffic Routing

With a waypoint proxy deployed, you can split traffic between different versions of the bookinfo reviews service. This is useful for testing new features or performing A/B testing.

For example, let's configure traffic routing to send 90% of requests to reviews-v1 and 10% to reviews-v2:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: reviews
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - group: ""
    kind: Service
    name: reviews
    port: 9080
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: reviews-v1
      port: 9080
      weight: 90
    - name: reviews-v2
      port: 9080
      weight: 10
EOF
----

If you open the Bookinfo application in your browser and refresh the page multiple times, you'll notice that most requests (90%) go to `reviews-v1`, which don't have any stars, while a smaller portion (10%) go to `reviews-v2`, which display black stars.

[[security-authorization]]
=== Security Authorization

The `AuthorizationPolicy` resource can be used in both sidecar mode and ambient mode. In ambient mode, authorization policies can either be targeted (for ztunnel enforcement) or attached (for waypoint enforcement). For an authorization policy to be attached to a waypoint it must have a `targetRef` which refers to the waypoint, or a Service which uses that waypoint.

When a waypoint proxy is added to a workload, you may have two possible places where you can enforce L4 policy (L7 policy can only be enforced at the waypoint proxy). Ideally you should attach your policy to the waypoint proxy, because the destination ztunnel will see traffic with the waypoint's identity, not the source identity once you have introduced a waypoint to the traffic path.

For example, let's add a L7 authorization policy that will explicitly allow a curl service to send `GET` requests to the `productpage` service, but perform no other operations:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: productpage-waypoint
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - kind: Service
    group: ""
    name: productpage
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals:
        - cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl
    to:
    - operation:
        methods: ["GET"]
EOF
----

Note the targetRefs field is used to specify the target service for the authorization policy of a waypoint proxy.

[[security-authentication]]
=== Security Authentication

Istio's peer authentication policies, which configure mutual TLS (mTLS) modes, are supported by ztunnel.
The difference of that between sidecar mode and ambient mode is the `DISABLE` mode policies. They will be ignored in ambient mode because ztunnel and HBONE implies the use of mTLS.
More information about Istio's peer authentication behavior can be found https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#peer-authentication[here].
