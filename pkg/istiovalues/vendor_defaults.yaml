# This file can be overwritten in vendor distributions of sail-operator to set
# vendor-specific defaults. You can configure version-specific defaults for
# every field in `spec.values` for both Istio and IstioCNI resource, 
# see the following example:
# 
# v1.26.0:
#   istio:
#     pilot:
#       env:
#         test: "true"
#   istiocni:
#     cni:
#       cniConfDir: custom/cni/conf/dir
#
# These defaults are type-checked at compile time.
# Note: After modifying this file, run `make test` to ensure that the
# generated defaults values from this files are valid.
