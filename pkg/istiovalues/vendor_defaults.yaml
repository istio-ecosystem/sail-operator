# This file can be overwritten in vendor distributions of sail-operator to set
# vendor-specific defaults. You can configure version-specific defaults for
# every field in `spec.values`, see the following example:
# 
# v1.24.2:
#   pilot:
#     env:
#       test: "true"
#
# These defaults are type-checked at compile time.
